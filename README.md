# Phase_1_project - Movie Production Recommendations

### Overview
A fictitious version of Microsoft is trying to start a new movie studio, but they don't know anything about the field. I used the data provided by Flatiron (a mix of data from review sites like IMDB and "The Numbers") to create three actionable insights for the studio and provided visualizations. This was done through basic data aggregation of previous movies. The three recommendations I came up with were to focus on producing movies from the two highest grossing genres (Animation & Adventure), have higher production budgets as this will yield to higher global grossing, and to release their movies during the months of May, June, July, or November since these months on average gross significantly more.

### Github structure
The main analysis takes place in the Student.ipynb notebook [link](student.ipynb). The data is stored in the folder ZippedData. I use the Sqlite database (im.db.zip) and the csv tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz for my analysis.
